        <h2 id="What"><strong>
            What Are Virtual Private Networks?
        </strong></h2>

        <p>
            VPNs establish a protected network connection when using public networks.
            VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity.
            This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data.
        </p>

        <h2 id="How"><strong>
            How Does A VPN Work?
        </strong></h2>

        <p>
            A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host.
            This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes the source of your data.
            This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online.
            A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into “gibberish”.
            Even if someone were to get their hands on your data, it would be useless.
